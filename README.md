# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a short list of notes created while getting my first introduction to coding. I am learning coding in order to make a career change that I believe will support a happier healthier lifGit, CSS, and JavaScript.

I've had to overcome a few obstacles to get here. I already had to replace my laptop, but I am really excited about the journey I am embarking on.

Its a really good feeling to be able to type a line of code and see it turn into something substantial.
